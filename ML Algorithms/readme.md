## Optimization & Improvisation in ML

It's about to make our ML model so efficient, fast and accuracy

1. Dimensionality Reduction Using Feature Extraction
2. Dimensionality Reduction using Feature Selection
3. Model Evaluation (Testing the accuracy of ML model)
4. Model Selection (Choosing the best algorithm for a ML problem)

Dimensionality reduction is a techniques to reduce the number of input variables in training data.

## What is Evaluation metrics ?

* Evaluation metrics are used to measure the quality of the statistical or machine learning model.
* Let's discuss evaluation metrics for classification in more detail!
* Key classification metrics we need to understand are:
1. Accuracy
2. Recall
3. Precision
4. F1- score
