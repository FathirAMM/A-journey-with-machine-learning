What is the difference between AI,ML,DL ?

AI is the broadest concept of all, and it give machines the ability to imitate human behavior.
ML is the application of AI into a system or machine, which helps it to self-learn and improve continuasly.
DL uses complex algorithms and deep neural networks to repetitively train a specific model or pattern.

What is ML ?

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications 
to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

What is machine learning algorithms?

A machine learning algorithm is the method by which the AI system conducts its task, 
generally predicting output values from given input data. 
The two main processes of machine learning algorithms are classification and regression.
Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

What are the types of machine learning?

Supervised learning     :the input features and the output labels are defined.
Unsupervised learning   :the dataset is unlabeled and the goal is to discover hidden relationships.
Reinforcement learning  :RL is the science of decision making.It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation.
Semi supervised learning:
