# Introduction

What is the difference between AI,ML,DL ?

AI is the broadest concept of all, and it give machines the ability to imitate human behavior.
ML is the application of AI into a system or machine, which helps it to self-learn and improve continuasly.
DL uses complex algorithms and deep neural networks to repetitively train a specific model or pattern.

<pre>
What is ML ?

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.

What is the difference between ML & DL?

DL can be handle large amount of data than ML and 
DL can process unstructured data such as documents, images, and text.
DL is more advanced than ML.
Deep learning uses a complex structure of algorithms modeled on the human brain.
DL teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans.
Deep Learning requires much more data than a traditional machine learning algorithm.
It doesn't work so well with small data.
DL teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans.

What is machine learning algorithms?

A machine learning algorithm is the method by which the AI system conducts its task, 
generally predicting output values from given input data. 
The two main processes of machine learning algorithms are classification and regression.
Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

What are the types of machine learning?

Supervised learning     :the input features and the output labels are defined.
Unsupervised learning   :the dataset is unlabeled and the goal is to discover hidden relationships.
Reinforcement learning  :RL is the science of decision making.It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation.
                         (speech recognition, NLP ,self driving vehicle)

## Some Terminologies
<pre>
Label         :Labels are the final output.
Feature       : Features are individual independent variables that act as the input in the system.
Regression    : Regression techniques are used when the output is real-valued based on continuous variables.
Classification: In classification, we will need to categorize data into predefined classes. 
                For example, an email can either be â€˜spamâ€™ or â€˜not spamâ€™.

## Bias,Variance,Overfitting,Underfitting
<pre>
Bias      : error in training data 
Variance  : test data error

<pre>
ðŸ¦–Bias and varinace in regression
Underfitting (High bias, High variance)
Generalized moodel (low bias, low variance)  :- optimal model
Overfitting  (Low bias , High variance)
</pre>

ðŸ¦–If the degree of the polynomial increase then flexibility of the line increase andmodel tends to overfitting.

ðŸ¦–Bias and varinace in classification
Underfitting (High bias, High variance)
	Training error 20%
	testing error  20%
Generalized moodel (low bias, low variance)  :- optimal model
	Training error <10%
	testing error  <10%
Overfitting  (Low bias , High variance)
	Training error 1%
	testing error 20%
